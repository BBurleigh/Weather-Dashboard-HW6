# Weather-Dashboard-HW6

## Description

Aside from this being a HW assignment, the goal of this challenge was to create an API Key (OpenWeather API), fetch information from openweathermap.com, store it in appropriate variables, and then display the information on the html after a user has input a city name. The displayed information would have appropriate icons, the temperature, humidity, UV index, and the five day forecast.

## Installation

No installation is needed for this app to run.

## Usage

A user could search the current weather conditions as well as the five day forecast for a city of their choosing.

## Contributions

Aside from myself and research, my tutor and some of the support staff at AskBCS Learning (on Slack) were pivotal in helping me better understand my code, make adjustments, and even where to start.
